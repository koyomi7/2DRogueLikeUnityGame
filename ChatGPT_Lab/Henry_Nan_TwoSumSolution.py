def two_sum(nums, target):
    """
    Finds two numbers in a list that sum up to a given target.

    Args:
        nums (List[int]): List of integers.
        target (int): Target sum.

    Returns:
        List[int]: Indices of the two numbers that sum up to the target, if found.
                   Returns an empty list if no such pair exists.

    Example:
        nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
        target = 9
        print(two_sum(nums, target))  # Output: [0, 1]
